# Starter Project

Welcome to the Dash Starter Project!

From the project directory, run
* `npm install` (you only need to do this if you are running it for the first time!)
* `npm start`
* `go to http://localhost:3000` in Chrome or Firefox

If you have issues (or if you're running it for the first time), run `npm install` in the project directory and repeat the above steps.

//CREATORS NOTES... how to use:

-RESIZE nodes by dragging the little triangle in their bottom righthand corner

-HOLD SHIFT to scroll the canvas. While shift is not down, resizing, typing and other node functions are enabled

-Nodes can be created and removed using the buttons in the top left menu

-Nodes can be organized into a grid pattern using an adjacent button

-Nodes can be given titles at the point of creation

-TO LINK NODES: Linking is not well optimized right now. The way it currently works, though:
    -Click the start linking button
    -Click on the same node again
    -This will link the node in question with all of the other nodes currently in the layout. Unfortunately, it also links
    the node to itself.
    -A list of links can be viewed in the dropdown menu that appears after the first link is completed

-Nested views are available to create in the same + Add Node menu!

-Enjoy, and thank you for the opportunity!
